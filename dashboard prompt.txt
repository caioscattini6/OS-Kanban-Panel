the panel is working fine

now I want it to show a modern and fluid dashboard, visual oriented,  containing:

- Total number of tickets opened in general

1. daily status (only numbers - based on the colors used on the panel)
- Total number of tickets 'entrada' today
- Total number of tickets moved to 'Enviar orçamento' today
- Total number of tickets moved to 'Ag. Aprovação' today
- Total number of tickets moved to 'Aprovado' today
- Total number of tickets moved to 'Pronto' today

2. monthly status 
- the same above, but monthly based


3. Average ticket handling time (in days and hours)
- Average time from 'entrada' to 'enviar orçamento'
- Average time from 'enviar orçamento' to 'ag. aprovação'
- Average time from 'ag. aprovação' to 'aprovado'
- Average time from 'aprovado' to 'pronto'
- average time from 'entrada' to 'pronto' - highlited this

4. Yield metrics (pizza graph)
Ratio between 'pronto' and 'sem conserto'

5. Overtime
Number of tickets above 10 days opened


In the upper section puts 2 and 4 
In the lower section, 1 and 3

The dashboard will be shown when click on a dynamic arrow in the right-side (that appears only when mouse hovers over it) - then it rolls from right to the left smoothly


Tell me which files should be changed and/or created to adapt this dashboard to my working JS structure:

meu-painel-os
 backup.json
 data.json
 package.json
 package-lock.json
 server.js
  \public
  index.html
  \css
  styles.css
